# **TODO**

### HEATMAPS CATEGORIES

* Store non-standardized dataframes
* Compute euclidean distance / cosine similarity
* Get activations closer to the mean for a misclassified sample and test if the classification is much better. (will be long to develop)
  * First hands on with a notebook (see boost.ipynb)
  * Then deploy it on the app
    * Only putting a boost button for misclassified samples
* Deploy loading pop-up
* Store p-values
