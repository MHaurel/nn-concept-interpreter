# **TODO**

### HEATMAPS CATEGORIES

#### ISSUES
* misclassified sample similarity is always 100
* Solve terminal error when loading a sample (not urgent)
* Can't go to next sample if pvalue filtered
* "sample" in right lists

#### TASKS

* Need to put 'neuron' in cols of the raw activations embedding df
* Get activations closer to the mean for a misclassified sample and test if the classification is much better. (will be long to develop)
  * First hands on with a notebook (see boost.ipynb)
  * Then deploy it on the app
    * Only putting a boost button for misclassified samples
* Deploy loading pop-up

* docstring

* Compile the app to make a desktop .exe
