# **TODO**

### HEATMAPS CATEGORIES

* Filter sample with the new pvalue heatmap of the compare category
* Compute euclidean distance / cosine similarity
  * Filter similarity pvalue
* Get activations closer to the mean for a misclassified sample and test if the classification is much better. (will be long to develop)
  * First hands on with a notebook (see boost.ipynb)
  * Then deploy it on the app
    * Only putting a boost button for misclassified samples
* Solve terminal error when loading a sample (not urgent)
* Deploy loading pop-up
* May create a directory *visualizer_data* to store heatmaps, activations and pvalues
* Issue with similarity (always 100)
* Possibility to drag n drop a item from a list to another and should not be possible
