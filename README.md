# **TODO**

### HEATMAPS CATEGORIES

* Compute euclidean distance / cosine similarity **(done)**
  * Filter similarity pvalue
* Get activations closer to the mean for a misclassified sample and test if the classification is much better. (will be long to develop)
  * First hands on with a notebook (see boost.ipynb)
  * Then deploy it on the app
    * Only putting a boost button for misclassified samples
* Deploy loading pop-up

* Solve terminal error when loading a sample (not urgent)
* May create a directory *visualizer_data* to store heatmaps, activations and pvalues
* Add similaritites in dheatmaps
